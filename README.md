## Project Background

"Anime" is a borrowed word from "Animation," meaning "animated film" in Japanese, mostly adapted from manga or light novel works. Anime has been around for a long time, but it has only recently gained significant attention and proven its allure through a series of blockbuster films with enormous revenues.  

However, with the immense number of anime available today (~12,000 series), finding shows that align with individual preferences can become challenging. Additionally, the need to connect the anime-loving community together or create a social network where viewers can store and share memories of the anime they have watched or are currently watching with their friends has become more essential than ever before. That is the reason why we embarked on this project.

## Project Timeline 

We started the project in March 2023 and completed it within a span of 2 months.

## Role in the Development Process

Throughout the project development, my role was that of a programmer and a key member of the project team. In this project, I took responsibility for the following functionalities:
  - Designing APIs related to user's Anime data.
  - Creating the user's profile page.
  - Implementing features for creating and editing posts.
  - Integrating user account linking with [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), a third-party service.

## Technical Highlights

Our product is built using React and Next.js (version 13), a powerful framework to create full-stack React web applications. This is some technical highlight in this project: 
  - By using the API route feature in Next.js 13, we were able to create an entire Anime API system without set up a Back-end server
  - Complete API Route System that allow us to interact with the third parties website like MyAnimeList: get anime information, get user information, update user detail, get user account token and refresh token to access the API.
  - Using Next.js 13 gives us the option to optimize rendering on the server with Static and Dynamic Rendering so that the loading time and redirect between each page will be faster for user
  - By using Firestore Database - a NoSQl database, which allows us to store and synchronize data in real-time between clients and the server. Its real-time capabilities enable seamless and instantaneous data updates, making it ideal for applications that require live data synchronization.
  - Recommendation System: we have built a system that can create an user feed and anime recommendation list that based on their anime watch history and interaction with other post
